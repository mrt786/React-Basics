From State: 
    form elements mantian their internal state not with react state
    for forms in react they will be updated by the setState
    controlled components

    input id and label must have a same id

    in form we use htmlfor instead of for

    when we are creating forms containing multiple inputs elements they need many functions plus so many state variables 
    this is not a good practice
    for this we to create a common handler for this
    i.e create an object array of this 
    and the input elements name must be same to the name of the key of objects

    Computed Property Name:
        [variable name] you access the property which have the first it's value can be evaluated then it can be used

    Use Effect:
        component render ho to us par agar hum koi kam karna chahte ha
        it has setup which are also called as functions this function is executed when the state is changed
