    we can create objects in the usestate
    let [moves,setmoves] = useState({   blue : 0, 
        green : 0,
        yellow : 0,
        red : 0})
        when we change the value of a key in js the object is not rerendered again
        for this we have to change/ replace the whole key
        similar for the arrays or send this by the spread operator as in this case a temporary value is created
        setmoves({...moves,blue: moves.blue+1});
        
        
        arrays ko bhi hum spread kar ke pass karte ha
        
    Unique Keys for a list item:
        Unique for every list. when we have multiple list and they are of same types 
        uuid ka through generate kar sakte ha
        import {v4 as uuidv4} from "uuid"
        to use we have to call the uuidv4

    simple functions ko arrow functions banane ka lia use call karte waqt use ke peecha arrow laga de ga us sa kia hoga ko wo use call 
        tb hi kare ga jab use karna hoga 
        ()=> deleteTask(todo.id)

    go to react rev and look for update arrays in state this will tell you methods that you have to avoid 
    
    functions as props:
        we can pass functions as a props
